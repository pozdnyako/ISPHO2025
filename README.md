# ISPHO 2025.
Some of the problems at ISPhO require numerical modeling implemented in Python.

# Python
To work with Python you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Don't forget to select "Add Python to PATH" during installation!

We use some packages, so to install them from online repositories run "install.bat". To test that everything is working on your PC run "test.bat". If you work on Linux or MacOS just run "install.py" and "test.py" with the command line.
